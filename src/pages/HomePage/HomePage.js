            <p>Welcome to my personal website! My name is Terrence Nolan.
                I'm a current senior at Villanova University studying Computer Science.
                In looking for a personal project to complete,
                I decided to build my own website: a practical resume, in a sense.
                This website was built primarily using React, TypeScript, and CSS.
                Feel free to check out my pages on here showing off different areas of my work!
